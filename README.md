# Azure Customer Churn Workshop / Hack Event

![hackathon design](/images/hackathon.jpg)

Letâ€™s get hands-on with __Azure Machine Learning__ by working through a customer churn prediction solution. During this event we will quickly gain experience with Azure Machine Learning and __Azure Databricks__. We can use the provided data to step though the documentation as a workshop or connect to your own data and _hack_ together an E2E solution for your specific needs.

## Objectives

- Learn how to __securely ingest data__ from __Azure Storage Account__ with _Azure Databricks__
- __Visualize and transform__ data using __Azure Databricks__ collaborative notebooks.
- __Track__ Machine Learning __Experiments__ with __Azure Machine Learning__
- Leverage __Azure Automated Machine Learning__ to accelerate identifying the _best_ model fro deployment
- __Register and deploy models__ with Azure Machine Learning
- Develop __CICD MLOPs__ with __Azure DevOps__, __Azure Databricks__ and __Azure Machine Leaning__
